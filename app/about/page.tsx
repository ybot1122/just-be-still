          My journey with sewing began right after high school when I learned
          the basics. In college, I had the opportunity to teach middle school
          kids crafts like knitting, cooking, baking, and needlework at ROHI
          camp during the summer! I have a passion for teaching kids. With a
          master&apos;s degree in instructional education, I have a deep
          understanding of effective teaching methods and am committed to
          providing a comprehensive and accessible learning experience for
          anyone interested in sewing.

          As a teacher, I understand the importance of hands-on practice. In my
          classes, students not only learn new techniques but also apply them to
          real-life projects. This approach ensures that they truly grasp the
          skills and feel a sense of accomplishment as they create useful items.

            At Just Be Still, we believe in the power of practical application
            to master any craft.

          By combining classroom-style instruction with practice projects, we
          help our students reinforce their understanding and build confidence
          in their abilities. We do service projects at the end of every year,
          making items for nursing homes, retirement centers, or youth services.
          My true passion lies in investing in the next generation of kids,
          nurturing their creativity, and providing them with the tools they
          need to succeed.
