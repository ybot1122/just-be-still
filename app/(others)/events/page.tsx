          This month, we had the joy of partnering with Green Hills Retirement
          Home to bring a little extra comfort and love to their residents. With
          55 residents eagerly awaiting handmade pillows, we got to work and
          created 55 beautiful, cozy pillows just for them!

          Delivering these heartfelt gifts was an unforgettable experience.
          Seeing their smiles and hearing their words of gratitude reminded us
          why we do what we do. Our hearts are full knowing we could spread some
          love and make them feel remembered this holiday season

          magic!
